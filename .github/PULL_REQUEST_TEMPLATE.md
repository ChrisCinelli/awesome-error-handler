### Pre-Submission

- [ ] I checked to ensure there aren't other open [Pull Requests](../../../pulls) for similar update/change (or I explain why this code may be better)
- [ ] `npm run lint` passed
<!-- 
  The following are optional until we get the tests in a good shape (but they should not be optional =) 
  The code comes from other projects and it was not meant to be a standalone module
  Tech debt will eventually have to be paid
-->
- [ ] `npm run test` passed
- [ ] All tests passed or I **fixed the tests** *without* deleting any test <!-- (or I will leave a note on this PR why these tests were **obsolete**) -->
- [ ] I added new tests to cover for my changes 
- [ ] I added explanation of what my changes do and why I think they should be included
