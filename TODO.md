# BUGS 
I kept the list here for the time being:

- [ ] Console stack trace colorize `internal/**` as default. Probably need to fork trycatch
- [ ] Try to manage unhandled promise with a domain

# TODO 
- [ ] Add at least a screenshot
- [ ] Fix linting
- [ ] Add good tests
- [ ] Add bin command "aeh-env" to generate the environment section of a Github issue or just add on option to generate it in the trace
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines and put a link in github templates and readme
- [ ] Refactor `colorize` name
- [ ] Add other examples
  - [ ] Different logger
  - [ ] Short tracktrace
  - [ ] Production vs Dev
  - [ ] Example of turning on trycatch (while the system is running)
